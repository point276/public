It exposes capital inefficiencies, codifies neutral return engines, and challenges convention — one component at a time.

This repo contains working code published alongside Point276 articles.

Each folder matches an article slug and reflects that article’s logic — not a Python module or installable package.  
The code illustrates ideas. It’s written for clarity and execution, not reuse.
